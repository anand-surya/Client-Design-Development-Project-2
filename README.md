Website Name: IST Dept

Description: 
    This is my interpretaion for the IST department's website. The data is obtained using AJX call from a proxy server. 
    This website is made to look different from the official site.

Technologies used:

    - HTML
    - Javascript
    - JQuery
    - CSS

Setup:
    Download the folder in the local machine
    Open the index.html file in Chrome, Firefox, or Edge browser.

Website walkthrough:
    1. Scroll through the website to see the different sections.

    2. Use the Navigation bar to scroll to specific sections. 

Plugins:

    - Materialize Frame-work
    - smooth-scroll
    - tablesorter
    - JQuery UI
    - Font awesome
    - Material Icons

Features: 

    - The website is resposive. I have used Materialize Grid to make it resposive.

    - I have used to Google's Materialize Frame-work to implement the material design. 
      All the elements are based on material design.
    
    - I have used minimal design concept to make the website look professional and attract the viewers.

    - The navbar is resposive, it transforms into side navbar on smaller screens.

    - I have used relevant and meaningful background images for the different sections. It gives a nice experience to the users. 
      The background images can be related to the details in the sections.

    - I have used card reveal component from material design for displaying the degrees. It displays more information on 
      the same card without opening a new page.
    
    - I have used accordion for displaying the undergrad minors. It provides a nice experience to the users. There is another
      accordion inside the minors to display the minor courses.

    - I have used font awesome and Material icons.

    - I have made the co-op and employment table sortable using the tablesorter plugin. The tables are displayed as a modal, which
      is enabled using a button in the site.

    - I have dispayed the faculty's and staff's image in the site to allow the users to identify them if they do not remember their
      names. The faculty's details like email and phone number can be viewed by clicking the button. The information is displayed as
      a modal.

    - The research area and research by faculty is displayed as modal. I have used lean model for the modal components.

    - I have used orange and grey color to relate to the RIT's color.

    - I tried to make the website seamless, to make it look continuous.
